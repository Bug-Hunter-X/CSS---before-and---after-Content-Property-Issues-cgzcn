# CSS ::before and ::after Content Property Issues

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the CSS `content` property used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.  Specifically, it highlights problems that can occur when generating large or complex content, leading to unexpected layout behaviors and performance issues. The example showcases scenarios where the generated content interacts with other CSS properties like `width`, `height`, and `overflow` in ways that may be difficult to predict.

## Bug Description
When using `::before` or `::after` to generate substantial content, such as a large amount of text or intricate SVG graphics, it may cause performance problems, visual glitches, or even browser crashes.  Interacting with other CSS properties often complicates this further.

## Solution
Solutions focus on optimizing the generated content and carefully managing its interaction with other CSS properties. This often includes:

* **Minimizing generated content:** Reducing the size and complexity of the generated content through optimization or alternative methods is key.
* **Using JavaScript for dynamic content:** For highly complex or dynamic content, JavaScript might be a more efficient and flexible approach.
* **Careful consideration of other CSS properties:** Properties like `width`, `height`, `overflow`, and `position` must be precisely defined to control and manage the generated content's behavior effectively.
