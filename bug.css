The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, if the generated content is too large or complex, it can cause unexpected layout issues or even browser crashes.  For example, generating a large amount of text or complex SVG within these pseudo-elements might lead to performance problems or visual glitches.  Another subtle issue arises when content interacts with other CSS properties, such as `width`, `height`, `overflow`, and `position`. The generated content might not behave as expected if these properties aren't carefully considered.
